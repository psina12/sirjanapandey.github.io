1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);

will immediately call the function.

 function booyah1(){

4:What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?

Ans: Unobtrusive Javascript is the practise of separating web pages into 3 different pages.
Content (HTML)
Presentation (CSS) 
Behavior (JavaScript)

It is because site vistors will not shut out even if Js is not working correctly for them and page load time is better.
It is also easy to update code as all the Javascript logic is present in seperate file.
