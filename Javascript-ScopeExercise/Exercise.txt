1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):

x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
  var x = 10;
  document.write(x);
  document.write(a);
  var f = function(a, b, c) {
     b = a;
     document.write(b);
     b = c;
     var x = 5;
  }
  f(a,b,c);
  document.write(b);
 }
c(8,9,10);
document.write(b);
document.write(x); 

Ans: "10 8 8 9 10 1" will be written to the document.


2.What is the difference between a method and function?

Ans:
  Method runs inside the object which is the property of object and has function.

syntax:
var name = {

 methodName: function(parameters){
  statements;

}
};

}

 Function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.

syntax:
function functionname(){

 content

}

3.What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?

Ans: 'this' is a reference variable which refers to the current object.


4.What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?

Ans: The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

 It has different values depending on where it is used:

-In a method, this refers to the owner object.
-Alone, this refers to the global object.
-In a function, this refers to the global object.
-In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
-In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
-Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.


5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?

Ans: In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object.


6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?

Ans: this refers to x object.

7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?

Ans. A free variable is simply a variable which is not declared inside a given function, but is used inside it.

8.Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music"and a property that is a function
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.

Ans:

var obj = {
  name: "fred",
  major: "music",
  sum:function(x,y){
    if(x==y){
    return x*y;
}  
 return Math.min(x,y);
  
}
 }


9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.

Ans: 

 class Employee{
   constructor(name,salary,position){
        this.name=name;
        this.salary=salary;
        this.position=position;
}
}

 var emp1= new Employee("Harry", 25000, "Manager")
 var emp1= new Employee("John", 10000, "Software Developer")
 var emp1= new Employee("Ashley", 15000, "QA tester")


10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.

Ans:

function myfunction (...args){

 return args.reduce(function (acc,cur){
  
  return acc*cur;

})
   
}

console.log(myfunction(5,6));


11.Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments  

Ans:var max = (x, y, z) => Math.max(x, y, z);
